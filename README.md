# New in C# 7.0

C# is a general-purpose, type-safe, object-oriented programming language. The goal of the language is programmer productivity. To this end, C# balances simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. The chief architect of the language since its first version is Anders Hejlsberg (creator of Turbo Pascal and architect of Delphi). The C# language is platform-neutral and works with a range of platform-specific compilers and frameworks, most notably the Microsoft .NET Framework for Windows.
